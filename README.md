# Clock Synchronizaton | Bloom Filter | Research
<br/>
Clock synchronization is a fundamental requirement in distributed system and it acts as a very demeaning fragment of huge infrastructure for any distributed system moreover time synchronization is a very important aspect when it comes to execution of task with help of multiple machines under a distributed environment. Existing clock synchronization algorithms has lead to several advantages and disadvantages.

On the basis of prior algorithms, an improved and efficient time synchronization algorithm is proposed to neutralize errors and the repository contains all the related files used in analysis and simulation results to prove the efficiency of the proposed protocol.
